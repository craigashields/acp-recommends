## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 

    ```
    git clone [repository url]
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd [project directory]
3. Install dependencies: 
    
    ```
    npm install
    ```


## Usage

Once the project is installed and set up, you can use it as follows:

1. Create `.env.local` in project directory. 
2. Add the following to the environment file
    
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
    ```

3. This project uses Supabase as a database for the image cards. In order to populate the above, you'll need a Supabase account and project. You'll be able to retrieve these values once this has been setup.

4. The `index.tsx` page queries a Supabase table. To setup the table in the same way as this project. Go to the Supabase SQL Editor and run the following:

    ```sql
    create table acp_recommends (
        id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
        created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
        comic text null,
        href text null,
        recommendBy text null,
        imageSrc text null,
        episode bigint null
    );
    ```

5. The project loads images and uses the `next/image` component. This component requires the image domain to be whitelisting in the `next.config.js` file. If it is not whitelisted, you will receive errors.

6. Once you are all setup run:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the results.

You'll be able to add new images to Supabase and your local version will automatically pickup the new records. However, once deployed, any new records added will not be shown. This is because it is using `getStaticProps`. In order to re-index the page once a new record has been added, you'll need to use Supabase database webhooks. Config like so:

1. Go to Database in Supabase
2. Select Webhooks - Create New Webhook
3. Setup a new HTTP Request webhook based on all changes to the Supabase table that was created above. As a HTTP Parameter, create one called `secret`. Generate an API key or add a password of your choice. The URL for the webhook should be `[Domain]/api/revalidate`. Checkout the `api/revalidate.ts` to see what it does.
4. In your hosting platform, in this case, I use Vercel, add an environment variable called `REVALIDATE_SECRET` and add the same API key value.

Supabase will trigger a website to this API everytime a change is made and the page will re-index and show your changes.
