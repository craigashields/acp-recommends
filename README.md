## Motivation

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Craig, a passionate comic book fan and the creator of this website dedicated to the Awesome Comics Podcast Recommends.As an ardent lover of comics, I wanted to contribute to the vibrant ACP community.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 

    ```
    git clone [repository url]
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd [project directory]
3. Install dependencies: 
    
    ```
    npm install
    ```


## Usage

Once the project is installed and set up, you can use it as follows:

1. Create `.env.local` in project directory. 
2. Add the following to the environment file
    
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
    ```

3. This project uses Supabase as a database for the image cards. In order to populate the above, you'll need a Supabase account and project. You'll be able to retrieve these values once this has been setup.

4. The `index.tsx` page queries a Supabase table. To setup the table in the same way as this project. Go to the Supabase SQL Editor and run the following:

    ```sql
    create table acp_recommends (
        id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
        created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
        comic text null,
        href text null,
        recommendBy text null,
        imageSrc text null,
        episode bigint null
    );
    ```

5. The project loads images and uses the `next/image` component. This component requires the image domain to be whitelisting in the `next.config.js` file. If it is not whitelisted, you will receive errors.

6. Once you are all setup run:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the results.
